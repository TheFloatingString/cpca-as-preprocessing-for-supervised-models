# Improving Classification Accuracy using Contrastive Principal Component Analysis

Notebooks can be run using Google Colab. The Google Colab environment should automatically take care of all dependencies and data downloads. 

### Notebooks

* `compare-cpca-with-other-methods.ipynb`: compares cPCA with other dimensionality reduction methods (runtime: ~34 seconds)
* `run-cpca-on-mnist-and-mouse-datasets.ipynb`: runs cPCA experiments on the MNIST and Mouse Down Syndrome Gene Expression datasets (runtime: ~244 seconds)
* `validate-cPCA-with-kNN.ipynb`: evalute k-NN 5-fold mean validation accuracy using PCA and cPCA pre-processed data (runtime: ~15 seconds)
